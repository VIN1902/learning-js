ABSTRACT AWAY THE LOWER-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE WHEN WRITING WITH PROMISES OR ASYNC/AWAIT

don't think anymore about how callbacks are flowing in the runtime (engine,queues,environment/api,eventloop, etc), if you find that too confusing or hard.

because:
- Promises and async/await donâ€™t create a new execution model.
- They just use the same concepts (callbacks, queues, closures) behind cleaner syntax.
- Its implementation details are intentionally abstracted away to work with them as black-box tools for async tasks. that's why they are called syntactical-sugar.
- Callbacks/Closures are raw JS logic and behaviour that is easy to 'see' how it works at low level.
*/

/*
Promise were introduced as syntax-sugar over callback.
Promise is a intermediate value which is immediatly returned so that the rest of the code can move on.

Promise has 3 states:
1. Pending - initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected
2. Fulfilled - operation was successfull
3. Rejected - operation failed
